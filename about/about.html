        <p>I have completed the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate through Coursera, where I'm gained hands-on experience in network security, threat detection, and incident response. My coursework included practical training in Python for security automation, Linux command-line tools, SQL for analyzing security data, and SIEM platforms for monitoring and mitigating threats. For the past six years, I  worked in the youth residential care industry, where I've been responsible for ensuring client safety, maintaining strict confidentiality, writing detailed incident reports, and applying crisis prevention and intervention strategies. For three of those six years I worked as a Junior Network Administrator for Detroit Job Corps. As a Junior IT Network Administrator at Detroit Job Corps, I assisted in monitoring and maintaining local area networks, ensuring reliable connectivity for staff and students. I provided technical support by troubleshooting hardware, software, and network issues, escalating complex problems to senior administrators when needed. Additionally, I helped with user account management, system updates, and documentation to support daily IT operations and security best practices. These responsibilities required strong situational awareness, calm decision-making under pressure, and a deep commitment to protecting othersâ€”skills that translate directly to cybersecurity work. Now, I'm channeling that same dedication into securing digital systems and data. I'm looking forward to connecting with fellow career changers, cybersecurity professionals, and tech enthusiasts who are passionate about safeguarding both people and information.
